# What does this add-on do?
Twitter doesn't indicate all circle tweets recently (tweets the sender shared with a limited group of followers), and you can't tell which tweets are exclusive to circle members. This add-on runs a simple script on Twitter and adds a left and right green border to circle tweets in your timeline.

# How to use in Firefox
You can install the add-on from the [Mozilla official site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/circle-tweet-detector/).
